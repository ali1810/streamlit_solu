# About AqSolPred1
Sol Prediction  is an  accurate solubility prediction model that consists consensus of 3 ML algorithms (Neural Nets, Random Forest, and XGBoost). 
AqSolPred is developed using a quality-oriented data selection method described in [1] and trained on AqSolDB [2] largest publicly available aqueous solubility dataset.
AqSolPred showed a top-performance (R2 - 0.95 )

If you are using the predictions from Sol Pred on your work,
